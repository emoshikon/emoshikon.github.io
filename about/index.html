        <div class="entry-content">
            <p>I like building stuff. I like having projects. And I think everyone should find ways to express themselves, even just for their own sake. This website is that, and my attempt in having my own space on the internet.</p>
<h2>But Why?</h2>
<p>Around the age of 10, my parents wanted me to learn to play the piano. I didn’t have the coordination needed to play with both hands, so I quitted.<br>
Between the ages of 10 to 12, I took Handball classes. I was probably one of the worst in the team. So I quitted.<br>
From 12 to 14, I took Basketball classes. I was probably one of the worst in the team. Although I quitted, I play till this day.<br>
Between the ages of 12 to 17, I flew radio-controlled model airplanes. Yeah, I got to teach and won some competitions, but never went the extra mile to try to become a pro. So I quitted.<br>
When I was 23, I figured out that I could never paint, but how about Photoshop or Illustrator? No, I ended up being creepy when my girlfriend looked at my “art” - a retouch of a photo of her - and was a bit horrified (I was only trying to glorify her). So I moved on.<br>
When I was 26, I took a photography class. In the end of the semester I looked back at my portfolio, and it all looked so ingenuous. I never found that “Decisive Moment”. So I moved on.<br>
When I was 27, I thought everyone can play the guitar, so why couldn’t I? I shouldn’t be deterred by that piano fiasco, right?  No, I can’t feel the beat. So I moved on.<br>
When I was 31, a neighbor, who is a painter, convinced me that everyone could draw. That was an important lesson, he was right and I was proud of myself. But no, I don’t grasp perspectives. So I moved on.</p>
<p>There are only two things I never stopped doing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Playing basketball. I’m quite mediocre, but I just love it.</li>
<li>Programming. My brother taught me BASIC when I was 7. Then Pascal, Visual Basic, Delphi &amp; Assembly in my teens. So coding is very natural to me, but like everything else in my life, I don’t have the perseverance needed in order to be really good at this. </li>
</ol>
<p>And that’s how I got to building this website. I want to make stuff, but I’m really bad in playing/painting/editing/photographing and much more. But less bad in writing code. So I guess that building a website is my wait of materializing some of my vision.</p>
<p>My first moshiklevin.com was written in PHP, circa 2006. Then next iteration was with WordPress. Then one thru Google Sites. Got tired of myself, so I decided I’ll just open a blog on Medium. Even that didn’t work, so went back to basics with some HTML &amp; Javascript, hosted on a Raspberry Pi. After a year I got the itch to install WordPress on that Raspberry Pi, so started learning how to do that again. While doing that, got to learn about Static Site Generators, so trying Pelican instead.</p>
<p>P.S. Or maybe my only talent in life is that I make people think I have some talents. But being unexceptional in many things is not necessarily bad. </p>
